First, I'll start with the code that was given in `working_example.Rmd`.

```{r package-data}

library(tidyverse) # loading package

sjer_veg <- read_csv("data/D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv") # loading data

```

Now, let's plot the graph that we'll be starting with.

```{r base-graph}

g <- sjer_veg %>% 
  select(maxcanopydiam, stemheight, livingcanopy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stemheight, y = maxcanopydiam)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = livingcanopy)) +
    scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "green")

```
